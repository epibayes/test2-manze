This relies on the docker image [jonzelner/rstan](https://hub.docker.com/r/jonzelner/rstan/) on Docker Hub.

Provided that you have Docker installed and up and running, all you need to do it to `docker pull jonzelner/rstan`, and then run everything from within the `reproducible-stan` directory using `./dockerbuild.sh`.
